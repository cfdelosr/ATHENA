            <p> This could potentially close that accessibility gap that many women experience. To get a good idea, we sampled 10 women from ages ranging from 18-65 years old, and asked them questions related to our app. The results are as followed. </p>

            <h2> Ultimately, we realized a trend that while most women don't have mental health or health tracking apps but understand a decent amount of women's health, they were interested in seeing a developed app that connects personalized AI and women's mental health. </h2>

<!------Final Design-------->
<section class="final">
    <h1> ATHENA's Final Design & Features </h1>
    <p> Along with the online questionnaire results, we also went through 3 rounds of verbal interviews with women within the same age range (18-65 years old) and showed them the app's development progress and more features they wanted to see. Based on the results from our interviews, we incorporated the following features into ATHENA's final design. </p>

    <div class="final">
        <div class="final-col">
            <h3>Casual and Human-Like Conversations</h3>
            <p> ATHENA is based off a GPT-3.5 language model. But when creating ATHENA, we implemented its training dialogue to include human-like interactions, empathy towards the user, and intro messages asking how the user is.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="final-col">
            <h3> Account Creation </h3>
            <p> In order to address the concerns involving AI privacy and security, you will need to sign in when first getting the app. You are able to either type in their email, or log in with Google, Facebook, and Apple. This way, all of your information is stored safely with ATHENA.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="final-col">
            <h3>App Engagement Streaks</h3>
            <p> The app will keep track of how many times you use the app each day, even when you don't use the chatbot itself. It will recognize everytime you are on the app and reward you with stars for day streaks, to encourage you to use the app more. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="final-col">
            <h3>Educated and Accurate Knowledge Bases</h3>
            <p> Misinformation can be scary. That's why we put peer-reviewed articles related to women's health and conditions into ATHENA's knowledge bases so it can tell you a more thorough and accurate description based on your topic of conversation. This way, it can educate you while also recognizing your mental health. </p>
        </div> 
        <div class="final-col">
            <h3>Appropriate Framework</h3>
            <p> We desire to help you with educating you how your experiences may impact your mental health. At times, it is best to contact your health provider. ATHENA will recognize this based on the questions you ask and the conversations you start, so that you can get the best accurate help you need. </p>
